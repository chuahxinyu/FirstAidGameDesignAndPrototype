## Gameplay
* Core Loop
  > What does the player do in the game?
  * The goal of the game is similar to that of first aid in real life: The 3P's - The Primary Goals of First Aid
    1. Preserve life
    2. Prevent further injury
    3. Promote recovery
  * 
* Progression
  > How does the player progress in the game?
  * 
* Controls
  > What does the player control in the game and how do they control it?
  * Movement
    * `W` move forward
    * `S` move backward
    * `A` move left
    * `D` move right
    * `Esc` show/hide cursor
    * `Q` show/hide extra information box
    * `1` interaction 1
    * `2` interaction 2
    * `3` interaction 3
    * `4` interaction 4
    * `TAB` exit
    * `LShift` sprint
    * `LCtrl` crouch
    * `LCtrl` change camera angle
    * `SPACE` jump
* Onboarding
  > What does the tutorial look like?
  * Great tutorials are the ones that are basically non-existent so the tutorials should be as invisible as possible and seamlessly integrated into the game. 
  > How does the player learn how to play the game?
  * 
  > How is the player taught about new systems and elements they encounter? 
  * 

## Level Design
> How many levels are in the game? How are they themed? What sort of things does the player do in these levels?
* Levels in the game are like chapters in a first aid textbook or sections in a first aid course. Each level teaches a specific part of first aid through a scenario.
> How does the player progress through these levels?
* Each level can have multiple endings, with each ending being either a 'failure' ending (ie. failed to)
> Are they linear or branching?
* 

## Art Direction
> What does the game look and feel like? 
* 

### References / Mood Board
> What other media informs the look of this game?
